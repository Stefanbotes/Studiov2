# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Preparation ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] Prisma schema is up to date
- [x] Migrations are created and tested
- [x] Database connection is verified
- [x] Production DATABASE_URL is configured

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Production URL (https://yourdomain.com)
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth (if using)
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth (if using)
- [ ] Any other application-specific variables

### 3. Code Preparation
- [ ] All code changes are committed
- [ ] Tests are passing
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling is implemented

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migrations

**IMPORTANT**: Always deploy migrations BEFORE deploying code!

```bash
# From your local machine with access to production DATABASE_URL
npm run migrate:deploy
```

Expected output:
```
2 migrations found in prisma/migrations
No pending migrations to apply.
```

### Step 2: Verify Database

```bash
node verify_database.js
```

Expected output:
```
=== Database Verification ===
✓ Database connection successful
✓ Found 21 tables
✓ Found 2 applied migrations
✓ All checks passed!
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git push origin deployment-fix-verified
```

Or using Vercel CLI:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Check deployment logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Test the application**:
   - [ ] Homepage loads
   - [ ] Authentication works
   - [ ] Database queries work
   - [ ] No console errors
3. **Monitor for errors** in the first few minutes

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Redirect Loop Issue
**Status**: FIXED
**Solution**: Removed problematic middleware that was causing infinite redirects

### ✅ Database Tables Missing
**Status**: FIXED
**Solution**: Applied Prisma migrations to production database

## Current Status

- **Branch**: deployment-fix-verified
- **Database**: Fully configured with 21 tables
- **Migrations**: 2 migrations applied
  - 20251020102014_init
  - 20251020102138_update_mode_schema
- **Prisma Client**: Generated and ready
- **Build Configuration**: Updated with proper scripts

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

### 1. Quick Rollback (Vercel)
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, go to deployments and revert to previous version
```

### 2. Database Rollback (if needed)
⚠️ **Use with extreme caution!**
```bash
# This should only be done if you have a backup
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back "migration_name"
# Then restore from backup
```

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. **Vercel Logs**: Check for errors
2. **Database Connections**: Monitor active connections
3. **Application Performance**: Response times
4. **Error Rates**: Track 500/400 errors

## Notes

- Middleware was removed to fix redirect loops
- Database tables were already created but needed migration tracking
- Used `prisma migrate resolve --applied` to baseline existing tables
- All verification tests passed successfully
