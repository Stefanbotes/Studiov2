# 🔧 Authentication Redirect Loop - Investigation & Fix Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Project:** Studio 2 NextJS Application  
**Issue:** Infinite redirect loop between login and dashboard pages  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Branch:** `deployment-fix-verified`  
**Commit:** `bfa1313`

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The Studio 2 application was experiencing an infinite redirect loop after successful authentication. Users could sign in successfully, but were immediately redirected back to the login page, creating a loop that prevented access to the dashboard.

**Root Cause:** A critical bug in the `Providers` component was preventing the `SessionProvider` from wrapping children during initial render, causing the session context to never be established properly.

**Solution:** Fixed the SessionProvider hydration issue, enhanced session handling, improved redirect logic, and added comprehensive debugging capabilities.

---

## 🔍 Investigation Process

### Step 1: Authentication Flow Analysis

I traced the complete authentication flow:

1. **Login Page** (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`):
   - User submits credentials
   - `signIn()` called with credentials
   - On success: redirects to `/dashboard`

2. **Dashboard Layout** (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`):
   - Checks for session using `getServerSession(authOptions)`
   - If no session found: redirects to `/auth/login`
   - **This is where the loop was occurring**

3. **Session Provider** (`components/providers.tsx`):
   - **FOUND THE BUG HERE** ⚠️

### Step 2: Root Cause Identification

#### 🐛 Critical Bug #1: SessionProvider Hydration Issue

**File:** `components/providers.tsx`

**The Problem:**
```typescript
export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true)
  }, [])

  if (!mounted) {
    return <div>{children}</div>  // ❌ CHILDREN WITHOUT SessionProvider!
  }

  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      {/* ... */}
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}
```

**Why This Caused the Loop:**
1. On initial render (server-side), `mounted` is `false`
2. Children are returned **WITHOUT** `SessionProvider` wrapper
3. Session context is never established on client side
4. Dashboard layout can't find session → redirects to login
5. Login succeeds but session still not available → redirects again
6. **Infinite loop** ♾️

**The Impact:**
- Session tokens were created on the server (authentication worked)
- But client-side session context was never established
- `getServerSession()` couldn't retrieve the session properly
- Every page load looked like an unauthenticated request

#### 🐛 Critical Bug #2: NEXTAUTH_URL Misconfiguration

**File:** `.env`

**The Problem:**
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # ❌ Wrong for Vercel deployment!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- NextAuth uses `NEXTAUTH_URL` to set cookie domains
- Cookies set for `localhost:3000` won't work on Vercel domain
- Session cookies won't be accessible → no session → redirect loop

### Step 3: Additional Issues Found

#### Issue #3: Redirect Logic
The login page used `router.push()` which is a soft navigation that may not fully reload the session.

#### Issue #4: Insufficient Debugging
Limited logging made it hard to diagnose where the authentication was failing.

#### Issue #5: Session Configuration
Basic session configuration without explicit settings for session lifetime and refresh.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: SessionProvider Hydration Fix ✅

**File:** `components/providers.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true)
  }, [])

  if (!mounted) {
    return <div>{children}</div>
  }

  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <SessionProvider
      refetchInterval={5 * 60}           // Refresh every 5 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus={true}        // Refresh when window regains focus
    >
      <ThemeProvider
        suppressHydrationWarning          // Prevent theme hydration warnings
      >
        {children}
        <Toaster position="top-right" />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed the problematic `mounted` check
- ✅ SessionProvider now always wraps children
- ✅ Added `refetchInterval` for session freshness
- ✅ Added `refetchOnWindowFocus` for better UX
- ✅ Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to ThemeProvider

### Fix #2: Enhanced Authentication Configuration ✅

**File:** `lib/auth.ts`

**Enhanced Session Configuration:**
```typescript
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  },
  pages: {
    signIn: "/auth/login",
    error: "/auth/login", // Redirect errors to login
  },
  // ... providers ...
}
```

**Added Redirect Callback:**
```typescript
callbacks: {
  async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
    console.log('🔀 Redirect callback - url:', url, 'baseUrl:', baseUrl)
    
    // Allows relative callback URLs
    if (url.startsWith("/")) {
      return `${baseUrl}${url}`
    }
    // Allows callback URLs on the same origin
    else if (new URL(url).origin === baseUrl) {
      return url
    }
    return baseUrl
  },
  // ... other callbacks ...
}
```

**Enhanced JWT & Session Callbacks:**
- Made callbacks `async` for consistency
- Added comprehensive logging
- Better type safety with explicit type casting
- More detailed debug information

### Fix #3: Improved Login Redirect Logic ✅

**File:** `app/auth/login/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (result?.ok) {
  toast.success("Welcome to Studio 2")
  router.push("/dashboard")
  router.refresh()
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (result?.ok) {
  console.log('✅ Login successful, redirecting to dashboard...')
  toast.success("Welcome to Studio 2")
  
  // Small delay to ensure session is fully established
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
  
  // Use window.location for a hard redirect to ensure session is loaded
  window.location.href = "/dashboard"
}
```

**Why `window.location.href`?**
- Forces a full page reload
- Ensures session is fully loaded from server
- Prevents soft navigation issues
- More reliable than `router.push()` for authentication redirects

### Fix #4: Enhanced Debugging ✅

**Added logging throughout the authentication flow:**

**In `lib/auth.ts`:**
```typescript
async jwt({ token, user, account }) {
  if (user) {
    console.log('🎫 JWT callback - Creating token for user:', user.email)
    // ...
  }
}

async session({ session, token }) {
  console.log('🔄 Session callback - Creating session with token:', {
    hasToken: !!token,
    tokenId: token.id,
    sessionUserEmail: session?.user?.email
  })
  // ...
}
```

**In `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:**
```typescript
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)

console.log('🔐 Dashboard Layout - Session check:', {
  hasSession: !!session,
  userEmail: session?.user?.email,
  userId: session?.user?.id,
})

if (!session) {
  console.log('⚠️  No session found, redirecting to login...')
  redirect("/auth/login")
}
```

**In `app/auth/login/page.tsx`:**
```typescript
if (result?.error) {
  console.error('❌ Login error:', result.error)
  // ...
}

if (result?.ok) {
  console.log('✅ Login successful, redirecting to dashboard...')
  // ...
}
```

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Why the Bug Was Hard to Detect

1. **Authentication actually worked** - The credentials were validated successfully
2. **Tokens were created** - JWT tokens were being generated
3. **Server-side was fine** - The issue was client-side context establishment
4. **Timing issue** - The bug only manifested during initial hydration

### Prevention for Future

To prevent similar issues:

1. **Avoid conditional provider wrapping** - Always wrap with providers
2. **Be careful with mounted checks** - They can break context
3. **Use proper NextAuth configuration** - Set all required options
4. **Add comprehensive logging** - Makes debugging much easier
5. **Test authentication thoroughly** - In both dev and production
