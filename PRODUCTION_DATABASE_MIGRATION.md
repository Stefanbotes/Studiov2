# Production Database Migration Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Task:** Run Prisma migrations on production Prisma Postgres database  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

---

## Overview

Successfully migrated the production Prisma Postgres database by applying all Prisma migrations to create the necessary tables for the Studio 2 application.

---

## Production Database Details

- **Database Provider:** Prisma Postgres
- **Database Host:** db.prisma.io:5432
- **Database Name:** postgres
- **Connection String:** `postgres://67a8040cb1f6f29fff6e965b617d5a8191bc40350789b08502623f87b1fdd7f6:sk_VWPvTwVcPa9sQIYExD_rc@db.prisma.io:5432/postgres?sslmode=require`

---

## Migration Process

### 1. Environment Setup
- ✅ Navigated to project directory: `/home/ubuntu/Studiov2_investigation`
- ✅ Verified Prisma schema and migrations directory
- ✅ Created backup of original `.env` file as `.env.before_production_migration`
- ✅ Temporarily updated `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to point to production database

### 2. Dependencies
- ✅ Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to ensure all dependencies were properly installed
- ✅ Verified Prisma CLI is available at `node_modules/.bin/prisma`

### 3. Migration Deployment
- ✅ Executed: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- ✅ Applied 2 migrations to production database:
  1. `20251020102014_init` - Initial schema creation
  2. `20251020102138_update_mode_schema` - Mode schema updates

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Ran `verify_database.js` script against production database
- ✅ Confirmed database connection successful
- ✅ Verified all tables were created

### 5. Cleanup
- ✅ Restored original `.env` file from backup

## Post-Migration Status

### ✅ Database is Ready for Production

The production Prisma Postgres database now has:
- All 32 required tables created
- All migration history recorded in `_prisma_migrations` table
- Database schema matches the Prisma schema definition
- All tables are accessible and functional

### Next Steps

1. **Vercel Deployment:** The app should now work correctly on Vercel since the database tables exist
2. **Environment Variables:** Ensure Vercel has the correct `DATABASE_URL` set to the production Prisma Postgres connection string
3. **Data Migration (if needed):** If there's existing data to migrate, it can now be imported into the production database
4. **Testing:** Test the deployed application to ensure all database operations work correctly

---

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security Considerations:**
- The production database connection string contains sensitive credentials
- Ensure it's stored securely in Vercel environment variables
- Never commit the production DATABASE_URL to version control

⚠️ **Backup Strategy:**
- Consider setting up regular database backups
- Document the backup and restore procedures

✅ **Migration Safety:**
- All migrations were applied successfully without errors
- The local `.env` file was restored to prevent accidental production database operations during development
- A backup of the configuration before migration was created: `.env.before_production_migration`

---

## Files Modified/Created

- `.env` - Temporarily modified, then restored
- `.env.before_production_migration` - Backup created
- `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_MIGRATION.md` - This documentation file

---

## Conclusion

The production database migration was **completed successfully**. All 32 tables have been created, migrations have been applied, and the database is ready for use with the Studio 2 application deployed on Vercel.

The Vercel deployment should now work correctly once the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is properly configured to point to this production database.
